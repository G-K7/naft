# NAFT - Network Appliance Forensic Toolkit

This project is a revival of the Didier Stevens original '[Network Appliance Forensic Toolkit](https://blog.didierstevens.com/programs/network-appliance-forensic-toolkit/)'. It is being updated to work with Python 3, with future plans for refactoring, streamlining, and a PyPi package.
